## Rant II 🤯

### Did you know that computer has many user?
- OS need to be reviewed
- ComOrg - more understanding about computer hardware
	- advantage + disadvantage

### SPA
- we will be learning to become **HIGHER** class of **USER**
- 🤓: as a SPA you need to know the in-and-out of the computer or the machine that you are moderate, in order for you to be able to understaind deeply and be able to find a way to upgrade the machine

### In the old days 👴🏻
- Prince of Persia history maybe interesting?
- developers developed a game using Assembly langauge because they need the full control of the memory because of the fact that they need to keep the hardware as low as possible while the hardware are still able to play the game 

### What's the difference between Emulation and Virtualization 🎮
-  Emulation, in short, involves making one system imitate another. For example, if a piece of software runs on system A and not on system B, we make system B “emulate” the working of system A. The software then runs on an emulation of system A.

- In this same example, virtualization would involve taking system A and splitting it into two servers, B and C. Both of these “virtual” servers are independent software containers, having their own access to software based resources – CPU, RAM, storage and networking – and can be rebooted independently. They behave exactly like real hardware, and an application or another computer would not be able to tell the difference.

### History of CPU 💻
- Single Task | Single User
- Multi Task | Single User
- Single core, Multi-thread
- more core doest always mean faster x amount of times
	- overhead is fucking massive 🤣
	- 🔥when distributing the tasks
	- 🔥when combining the tasks
	- 🔥when communicating between the core (coupled-task)

#### These techniques that make your CPU go brrrr 🌬
- Cache
- Pipelining
- Superscalar

#### AMD Vs Intel
- "Ryzen" make AMD caught up to Intel 😂
	- because it uses **"branch predication"** to predict the next command from the previous ones in a conditional statement, loop

### File System
- share file system across network
- multi user
- system admin need to admins the network "by the order of the organization" 
	- eg. give **"permissions"** 

### What are the resources that SPA need to be considering?
- **Computing Power**: จัดสรรให้เหมาะกับ process
- **Memory**
- **Storage**: เก็บอะไร ความคุ้มค่า ราคา การจัดแบ่งพื้นที่ให้เหมาะสม
- **Network Connection**: ประสานงาน, แก้ไขปัญหา, upgrade
