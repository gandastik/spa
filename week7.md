### Unix file 🗃️
- everything is a binary files but in the different forms (universally)
	- jpeg 
	- pdf
	- mp3
- file extension is just for the convenient of "file association" 💥
	- just to tell which program that uses to open the file 😎

### Linux Command
- cat
- hexdump
- grep
- ls
- pipe `|`

- then bro just went on a rant about `cat`, `od`, `hexdump`, `head`, `tail` for just displaying a files for like 2 hours 🤮
	- big endian, small endian

### Linux OS

#### Linux Redirection
- `>` output redirection (rewrite all)
- `>>` outpute redirection (append)
	- `who > users`
	- `echo line 2 >> users`
 - `<` input redirection

#### Pipe 😵
- `|` called "pipe" output of one program -> input of another program

### Homework lol 😂
- learn more about unix redirection `>, >>, <, |`
- learn more about unix file permission `drwxrwxr--`
	- **reason why** -> because its multi-user so everybody cant have the same permission and for security measure such as cant have a nobody accessing or writing your file without your permission
